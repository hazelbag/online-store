Hey Tav

Here is the notes page I mentioned.

Currently as on the product page you will see there is prices linked from the js file to the items on the product html page.
However, on the html file 5 - marlin you will see that the price indicates as per the js but the pages after that the price does not write to the innerHTML section, why would this be?

Then with regards to said, if you click the add to cart buttons, how will I get these items to write to the cart file(shipping option can be done via a drop down I believe on the cart page?), I am having
difficulty with this section of the task. (Please ignore no styling for now please, I need to do styling still)

Jacques
